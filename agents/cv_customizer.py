        JOB ANALYSIS:

        TASK:
        1. Rewrite the "Professional Summary" to highlight relevant experience for THIS job (2-3 sentences only, no repetition).
        2. Reorder and filter "Core Skills" to prioritize the job's "must_have_skills". Remove duplicates.
        3. Select ONLY the top 3-4 most relevant "Work Experience" entries that match the job requirements.
        4. For each selected role, rewrite bullet points to:
           - Use keywords from the job description
           - Emphasize overlapping skills
           - Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) where possible
           - Keep only 3-4 most impactful achievements per role (no repetition)
        5. Include ALL education entries (but only once, no duplicates).
        6. DO NOT repeat the same information in different sections.
        7. If an experience/education appears multiple times, include it only once.
        
        OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
        {{
            "personal_info": {{ ...keep original... }},
            "summary": "Tailored summary...",
            "skills": {{
                "Technical": ["..."],
                "Soft Skills": ["..."]
            }},
            "experience": [
                {{
                    "company": "...",
                    "title": "...",
                    "dates": "...",
                    "achievements": [
                        "Optimized bullet point 1...",
                        "Optimized bullet point 2..."

                }}
            ],
            "education": [ ...keep original... ]
        }}

        CRITICAL RULES:
        1. Do NOT invent experiences. Only reframe existing ones.
        2. Use EXACT vocabulary from the job analysis where applicable.
        3. Focus on impact and metrics (STAR method).
        4. Maintain a professional, executive tone.
        5. NO REPETITION: Each piece of information should appear only once.
        6. NO DUPLICATES: If the same experience/education appears multiple times in input, include it only once.
        7. BE CONCISE: Summary should be 2-3 sentences, not repeating what's in experience section.
        8. FILTER WISELY: Only include experiences that are relevant to the job. Skip irrelevant ones.
